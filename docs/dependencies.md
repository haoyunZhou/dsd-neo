# Dependency Management

DSD-neo keeps runtime, packaging, and analysis dependencies explicit so changes
are reviewable.

## Compiled Dependencies

Required dependencies are:

- C compiler with C11 support
- C++ compiler with C++14 support
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- OpenSSL 3.x libcrypto
- `mbe-neo` 2.x CMake package from mbelib-neo
- libsndfile
- curses backend: ncursesw/PDCurses. macOS ships no `libncursesw` — its unified
  `libncurses` carries the wide entry points behind `_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED` —
  so configure prefers a wide ncurses when the host has one (including
  Homebrew's keg-only `ncurses`, which is on no default search path) and
  otherwise falls back to the SDK's curses, reporting which it took. Nothing in
  the ncurses path calls the wide API, so the fallback is a complete build.
- audio backend: PulseAudio by default on Unix-like systems, PortAudio on
  Windows

Optional compiled dependencies are:

- librtlsdr for RTL-SDR input. RTL-SDR Blog V4 and V4 Lite dongles need
  librtlsdr 2.0.3 or newer (older releases misdetect their R828D/R828S tuners
  as an R820T); the versions this project pins for CI, Windows and Android
  builds are 2.0.3
- SoapySDR 0.8.1 or newer for non-RTL SDR devices; the CMake package must
  export an imported target (`SoapySDR` or `SoapySDR::SoapySDR`)
- Codec2 for additional vocoder paths. On Windows and Android it comes from the
  vcpkg manifest, and those presets set `DSD_REQUIRE_CODEC2=ON` (with
  `DSD_REQUIRE_CURL=ON`) so a missing dependency fails configure instead of
  silently dropping M17 voice or rdio uploads.
- libcurl 7.56.0 or newer for rdio-scanner API uploads. Builds older than
  7.85 use the integer protocol-mask option needed by the Ubuntu 20.04
  AppImage toolchain; remove that branch when portable packaging no longer
  supports libcurl below 7.85.
- expat 2.x for RadioReference trunking-data import. On Windows and Android it
  comes from the vcpkg manifest, and those presets set `DSD_REQUIRE_EXPAT=ON`.
- PortAudio on non-Windows builds when selected
- help2man for generated man pages

Vendored and embedded third-party components include:

- ezpwd Reed-Solomon under `src/third_party/ezpwd/`
- PFFFT/FFTPACK under `src/third_party/pffft/`
- Tiny AES code in `src/crypto/crypt-aes.c`

Vendored code and embedded upstream-derived snippets retain upstream notices.
License and attribution details are in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.

Registry-managed vcpkg dependencies are pinned by the manifest
`builtin-baseline` (`9e593bb18ea69cc5095e012465dcd675a822ed0d` in the current
manifest). The baseline, overlay ports, and triplets are the source of truth
for exact registry versions; system-package builds enforce the OpenSSL
requirement through `find_package(OpenSSL 3.0 REQUIRED)`.

## Packaging Dependencies

Windows builds use vcpkg overlays under `vcpkg-ports/` and triplets under
`vcpkg-triplets/`. AppImage builds use pinned CI source checkouts for compiled
dependencies that are not suitable from the Ubuntu 20.04 base image, including
SoapySDR 0.8.1 or newer. Linux source-install validation uses pinned Docker
images from `tools/ci-dependency-pins.env` to exercise apt, dnf, zypper, apk,
and pacman bootstrap paths. Overlay ports, CI source checkouts, and validation
container images must use immutable source references and hashes as described in
`docs/supply-chain-guardrails.md`.

## Tooling Dependencies

CI and local quality tools are tracked through:

- `.github/requirements/*.in`
- `.github/requirements/*.txt`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `tools/*.sh`

Hashed Python requirements are used where Python tooling is installed in CI.
GitHub Actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs by policy.

## Monitoring

The project monitors dependencies through:

- Dependabot for GitHub Actions and Python requirements
- GitHub dependency review on pull requests
- OSV-Scanner through `tools/osv_scan.sh`
- scheduled guardrail CI
- OpenSSF Scorecard

If a vulnerability is reported in a dependency:

1. Determine whether the vulnerable code is present and reachable.
2. Update or patch the dependency when exploitable.
3. If not exploitable, document the reason in the narrowest available
   suppression, VEX note, or advisory note.
4. Add tests or checks when the issue could regress.

## Update Policy

Dependency updates should:

- preserve license notices
- avoid unrelated refactors
- update documentation when dependency behavior or requirements change
- run focused protocol, DSP, runtime, or packaging tests as applicable
- run `tools/osv_scan.sh`
- receive human review when they affect compiled code, workflows, packaging, or
  release behavior

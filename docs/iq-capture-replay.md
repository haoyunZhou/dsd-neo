# IQ Capture And Replay

This guide covers `dsd-neo` RF/baseband I/Q capture and replay.

Capture writes a raw I/Q data file plus a metadata sidecar. Replay reads that metadata/data pair and feeds the same
RTL demodulation path used by live radio input.

## Quick Commands

```bash
dsd-neo -i rtl:0:851.375M:22:0:48:0:2 --iq-capture p25-control.iq -N
dsd-neo --iq-info p25-control.iq.json
dsd-neo --iq-replay p25-control.iq.json -f1 -N
```

## CLI Flags

- `--iq-capture <path>`: enable I/Q capture.
- `--iq-capture-format <cu8|cf32>`: requested capture format (default `cu8`).
- `--iq-capture-max-mb <n>`: size limit in MiB (`0` means unlimited). Decode continues after capture writer stops.
- `--iq-replay <path>`: replay a capture file pair.
- `--iq-replay-rate <fast|realtime>`: replay pacing mode (default `fast`).
- `--iq-loop`: loop replay at EOF.
- `--iq-info <path>`: print metadata/size/alignment summary and exit.

Path handling:

- If the supplied capture path ends in `.json`, it is treated as metadata path and data path becomes the same name
  without `.json`.
- Otherwise the supplied capture path is treated as data path and metadata path becomes `<path>.json`.
- `--iq-replay` and `--iq-info` accept either metadata path or data path.

## Format Notes

Metadata is JSON with `format: "dsd-neo-iq"`.

- `version: 1` is used for legacy single-segment captures with no replay event timeline.
- `version: 2` is used when the capture contains a replay event timeline.

The writer records:

- sample format (`cu8` or `cf32`), sample rate, and tuned centers.
- capture-time transform policy (`fs4_shift_enabled`, `combine_rotate_enabled`, `offset_tuning_enabled`).
- replay rate-chain fields (`base_decimation`, `post_downsample`, `demod_rate_hz`).
- source identity (`source_backend`, `source_args`).
- finalized byte/counter fields (`data_bytes`, `capture_drops`, `capture_drop_blocks`, `input_ring_drops`).
- retune fields (`contains_retunes`, `capture_retune_count`).
- for v2 captures, an `events` array describing scheduled replay events.

The v2 `events` array is ordered by capture-data `byte_offset`, not wall-clock time. Replay dispatches every event at an
offset when the reader reaches that byte position in the data stream. Equal offsets are allowed and preserve file order.

Event objects contain:

- `kind`: `RETUNE`, `MUTE`, or `RESET`.
- `byte_offset`: capture-data byte offset where the event applies.
- `reason`: a short event source/reason string.
- `duration_bytes`: required for `MUTE`; omitted muted data duration in capture-data bytes.
- `center_frequency_hz`, `capture_center_frequency_hz`, and `sample_rate_hz`: required for `RETUNE` and `RESET`.

The legacy summary fields remain present. `contains_retunes` and `capture_retune_count` summarize retune activity, while
the v2 `events` array provides the ordering needed for replay.

`--iq-info` reports:

- metadata bytes vs actual file bytes.
- aligned effective replay bytes and estimated duration.
- event timeline count.
- warnings for interrupted captures (`data_bytes == 0`), metadata/data mismatch, misalignment, and retune-containing
  captures that do not include a replay event timeline.

Replay uses `min(data_bytes, actual_file_size)` rounded down to sample alignment after metadata is finalized. If an
interrupted capture never finalized metadata (`data_bytes == 0`), replay falls back to the actual file size and still
rounds down to sample alignment. Zero effective bytes are rejected for `--iq-replay`.

## Operational Limits

- `--iq-capture` and `--iq-replay` are mutually exclusive in one invocation.
- Single-segment v1 captures continue to replay unchanged.
- Retuned captures are replayable only when they include a v2 event timeline. Older retuned v1 captures with
  `contains_retunes: true` and no `events` array are rejected because they do not preserve enough ordering data to replay
  safely.
- `RETUNE` events update replay-visible center frequency state. `RESET` events apply the same demod reset/purge/output
  handling used by live retunes. `MUTE` events emit no samples, but advance replay phase accounting and realtime virtual
  sample time by `duration_bytes`.
- `--iq-loop` rewinds the event cursor and replay timing so the event schedule repeats each pass.
- User/API retune requests during IQ replay remain ignored; only metadata-scheduled replay events are applied.
- Event timelines currently require a constant sample rate through the capture. Metadata with event sample-rate changes is
  rejected until segment-rate replay is supported.
- Direct `-i iqreplay:...` is intentionally rejected; use `--iq-replay <path>`.
- Replay currently feeds the RTL radio path and reuses existing demod processing/state handling.

## Backend Notes

- Capture is available on live radio inputs only: RTL USB, RTL-TCP, and SoapySDR when the active Soapy stream is `CF32`.
- RTL USB / RTL-TCP captures are `cu8`.
- `--iq-capture-format cf32` is only valid when the active backend stream is native `cf32` (for example Soapy CF32).
- Soapy drivers that only provide `CS16` can be used for live decode, but are not currently accepted by the IQ capture
  CLI.
- If requested capture format does not match the active backend stream format, startup fails with a clear error.

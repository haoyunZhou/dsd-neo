# Terminal UI (ncurses) Guide

This guide covers the interactive terminal UI enabled with `--frontend terminal`: how to open the menu overlay and the most useful
hotkeys.

For CLI flags and inputs/outputs, see `docs/cli.md`.

## Start the UI

- Enable UI: `dsd-neo --frontend terminal ...`
- Quit: `q`
- Open the menu overlay: `Enter`

Tip: Many screens print a short hotkey hint line in the footer while you’re running.

## Menu Overlay

Press `Enter` to open the nonblocking menu overlay. While it is open, keypresses go to the menu (hotkeys are not
processed).

Common controls:

- Move selection: arrow keys (`Up`/`Down`), `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Home`/`End`
- Select / open submenu: `Enter`, `Right`
- Back / close: `Esc`, `q`/`Q`, `Left`
- Item help: `h`

Group policy reload:

- In the Trunking/Import menu path, importing a group list (`-G` CSV) performs a full policy reload. On parse failure,
  the currently loaded list remains active.

Config profiles:

- In the Config menu, `Load Profile...` lists `[profile.NAME]` sections from the active config path, or the default
  config path when no config has been loaded yet. Loading a profile applies it to the running session and disables
  autosave, matching CLI `--profile NAME` behavior.

## DSP Status

The DSP status panel shows RTL DSP loop state when RTL input support is available. CQPSK mode reports FLL band-edge,
carrier/Costas, NCO, and timing-recovery state for the active OP25-style chain.

For RTL-family inputs, the optional DSP panel also shows `Squelch`, which compares post-channel-filter power against the
configured SQL threshold. This is an advanced squelch diagnostic and is separate from the raw `RF Level` health line.

## Input Level Health

The input section shows a persistent advisory line when recent input-level metrics are available:

```text
| Input Level: OK rms -23.1 dBFS peak -5.4 dBFS clip 0.0%
| RF Level: CLIP rms -6.0 dBFS peak 0.0 dBFS clip 0.3% lower RF gain or add filtering/attenuation
```

`Input Level` is used for PCM-like audio inputs. `RF Level` is used for RTL-SDR, rtl_tcp, and SoapySDR receiver
samples measured before demodulation. The line is advisory only; DSD-neo never changes input volume, RF gain, AGC, or
filtering automatically.

The default RTL input line shows the SQL threshold but does not duplicate channel power. Enable the DSP panel when you
need to inspect post-channel-filter squelch power. `RF Level` and `Squelch` are measured at different stages and are not
expected to match exactly.

The low-level threshold is controlled by `--input-level-warn-db` or `DSD_NEO_INPUT_WARN_DB` and defaults to `-40 dBFS`.
Hot/clipping advisories use fixed thresholds: peak at or above `-1.0 dBFS` is `HOT`, and at least `0.1%` clipped or
near-rail samples is `CLIP`. Footer messages are rate-limited. RF low-level status remains persistent but does not
produce repeated low-level footer messages because a quiet channel and too little RF gain are not reliably
distinguishable from raw receiver samples alone. TCP PCM input suppresses repeated LOW/HOT/CLIP footer messages while
the decoder is idle/searching; the persistent `Input Level` line still shows the current status.

## Hotkeys (Main Screen)

Keys are case-sensitive. Some commands only make sense in specific modes (for example, trunking controls require
trunking/scanner to be enabled, and RTL controls require RTL input).

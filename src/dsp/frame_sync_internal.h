/**

 *
 * One full rotation of the hunt at the default dwell: DSD_FRAME_SYNC_SPS_PROFILE_COUNT profiles
 * of dsd_frame_sync_sps_hunt_dwell_passes() x DSD_FRAME_SYNC_NO_SYNC_PASS_SYMBOLS. That is what
 * the span has to cover to do its job at all, and it is tight rather than padded: from the proof,
 * the hunt spends at most one dwell finishing on 2400/4 -- the proof restarted that counter -- one
 * each traversing 9600/2, 6000/4 and 4800/2, and the guard must still be standing through the
 * whole of the first 4800/4 dwell, where the claimants are. Builds without some of those
 * candidates simply arrive sooner.
 *
 * The other bound is what it costs a signal that is really there: a transmission that has genuinely
 * ended frees 4800/4 for real NXDN96 and M17 within one rotation of its last proof, and a rotation
 * is mostly spent on profiles neither of them uses. Where the dwell is longer -- an untuned P25
 * trunk takes five passes -- the rotation outruns this span, so the guard thins out rather than
 * over-reaching, and the profile hold that PROFILE_PROVEN itself buys stays the primary defence
 * (see dsd_frame_sync_suppress_4800_4_for_2400_4_transmission()).

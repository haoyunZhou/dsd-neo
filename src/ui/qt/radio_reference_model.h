/**
 * @file
 * @brief QML-facing brain for the RadioReference.com import.
 *
 * Owns a dsd_rr_client, drives the browse pipeline (zip or country/state/county
 * to systems to sites), previews what an import would produce, and writes the
 * generated CSVs into the imported-files library with provenance.
 *
 * Two rules shape this header and must survive edits:
 *
 * 1. No USE_EXPAT / USE_CURL conditional and no curl or expat type appears here.
 *    dsd-neo_ui_qt links dsd-neo_runtime PRIVATE, so the Android JNI sources
 *    compile without those defines; a conditional member would be an ODR violation that
 *    links cleanly and crashes at run time. Availability is answered at run time
 *    by dsd_rr_available().
 * 2. The password lives in a plain member for the process lifetime and is never
 *    persisted, never logged, and never bound into a QML property. No credential
 *    may reach statusText, errorText, or any other user-visible string.

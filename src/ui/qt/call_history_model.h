/**
 * @file
 * @brief Structured, persistent call log behind the history screen and the
 *        monitor's recent-calls panel.
 *
 * Rows are ingested from the published snapshot's event-history ring — committed
 * voice rows plus data/control notices (SMS, LRRP positions, data calls), keyed
 * so a ring that shifts under us never double-counts — and persisted as JSON so
 * the log survives sessions and process death, which the in-memory event ring
 * deliberately does not. Refreshed from the single UI poll tick only.
 *
 * This model is the store alone: every view that shows it binds through its own
 * CallHistoryFilterModel, so one screen's search or pills never filter another.

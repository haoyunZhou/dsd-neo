/**
 * @file
 * @brief Frequency/bin/viewport arithmetic for the spectrum view.
 *
 * Deliberately Qt-free and header-only so the parts that are easy to get
 * subtly wrong — which bin a tap lands on, where a clamped pan window sits,
 * whether a pinch keeps the frequency under the fingers still — are testable
 * without a window, a scene graph, or a running decoder.
 *
 * Bin convention matches what the io layer actually publishes: bins are
 * fftshifted, so bin i of n sits at `center + (i - n/2) * span/n`. Bin n/2 is
 * DC, i.e. exactly the tuned center. (A tempting alternative is to treat the n
 * bins as tiles and put bin centers at `(i + 0.5) * span/n`; that is off by
 * half a bin — 750 Hz at n=1024 over 1.536 MHz — and would bias every
 * tap-to-tune by that much.)

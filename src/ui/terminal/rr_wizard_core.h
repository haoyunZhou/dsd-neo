 * @brief RadioReference import wizard: the curses-free state machine.
 *
 * This core owns the step sequence, the credentials, the RadioReference client
 * and the worker->UI result marshaling. It draws nothing and includes no
 * curses: the presenter supplies every widget through RrWizardHooks. Nothing
 * enforces that seam at build time - cmake/arch_rules.cmake bans curses only
 * OUTSIDE src/ui/terminal/ - so the headless UI_RR_WIZARD target, which
 * compiles rr_wizard_core.c directly and links no UI library, is the only
 * thing that will catch a curses include creeping in here.
 *
 * Threads: every function below runs on the UI thread. The only exception is
 * the client's completion callback, which runs on the RadioReference worker
 * and does nothing but park a result in a mutex-guarded ring;
 * rr_wizard_core_pump() drains that ring back on the UI thread.
 *
 * rr_wizard_core_pump() is driven by rr_panel_tick(), which ui_menu_tick()
 * reaches on the UI thread's input loop.

 * from and the partial-encryption answer that was given. A refresh matches
 * those stored ids against the freshly fetched site list, regenerates the one
 * CSV the sidecar names, validates the regenerated bytes in a staging file and
 * only then replaces the stored copy. It never re-tunes, never changes the
 * decode mode and never applies a full import; its only effect on a running
 * session is asking it to re-read the file, and only when the session is
 * already using that exact path.
 *
 * Missing credentials REFUSE rather than routing into the RR_STEP_CREDS_*

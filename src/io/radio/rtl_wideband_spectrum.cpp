/**
 * @file
 * @brief Wideband (capture-rate) spectrum snapshots for the graphical spectrum view.
 *
 * Separate from rtl_metrics.cpp on purpose. That module publishes a *narrow*,
 * post-decimation spectrum at the demod output rate which feeds the supervisory
 * tuner auto-gain gate (`demod_autogain_spectral_gate_ok()`); retuning its size,
 * rate, or smoothing to also serve a UI would regress gain control. This module
 * taps the block before decimation instead, costs nothing until a consumer
 * enables it, and carries the tuned center and span alongside the bins so the
 * consumer can label a frequency axis.
 *
 * Only the generic plumbing both need — a cached pffft setup and a cached Hann
 * window — is shared, through rtl_fft_cache.h, as caches each module owns an
 * instance of. Sharing the *state* would be wrong: the two run on this same
 * thread at different sizes, so one cache between them would destroy and
 * rebuild the setup on every alternating call.
 *
 * Threading: `rtl_wideband_spectrum_maybe_update()` runs on the demod thread
 * and is the only writer. Readers may call `rtl_stream_wideband_spectrum_get()`
 * from any thread; a seqlock keeps the bins consistent with the center/span
 * they were captured at, because a torn axis-vs-bins frame is visibly wrong on
 * a waterfall.

/*
 * Hysteresis for the NXDN cipher field.
 *
 * The 2-bit cipher type reaches the decoder from several channels -- VCALL in
 * SACCH/FACCH/CAC, the DCR SACCH-2 message, and the SCCH call option -- and
 * each sits behind FEC and a short CRC that can accept a miscorrected payload
 * at low SNR. Acting on every observation directly let a single corrupt
 * element mute a clear call (or silently unmute an encrypted one), and under
 * --enc-lockout write a session-permanent blocking talkgroup entry and force
 * the channel released -- the same single-observation defect class fixed for
 * P25 in #280. This module makes the applied cipher sticky: observations
 * apply tentatively and must repeat before they can flip an established
 * classification, user-forced scrambler modes apply as authoritative, and the
 * lockout only acts on an established non-clear classification.
 *
 * The class fields store the observed cipher plus one so 0 can mean "no
 * observation this transmission"; cipher 0 (clear) is a real observed value.

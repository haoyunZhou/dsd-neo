/**
 * @file
 * @brief Whether an NXDN frame has proved itself well enough to be acted on.
 *
 * Everything upstream of this is weak. The sync search slices on sign alone, so its
 * 10-symbol frame sync word matches about 1% of receiver noise; the LICH that follows
 * carries one parity bit and is checked against a table holding 55 of the 128 possible
 * values, so roughly a fifth of those noise syncs reach the frame body. P25 and DMR do
 * not behave this way on an open squelch because their equivalent gates -- a 63-bit BCH
 * on the P25 NID, Golay and a two-observation colour-code lock on DMR -- are strong
 * enough to stand alone. NXDN's are not, and on a quiet channel the result was a stream
 * of invented RANs, synthesized voice, and a conventional scan that would not move on
 * (issue #398).
 *
 * So the frame body has to say something checkable before the decoder treats a frame as
 * real. A CRC of 12 bits or more is proof by itself. The 6- and 7-bit CRCs on SACCH and
 * SCCH are not -- one in 64 noise frames passes a CRC-6 -- so they have to repeat: two
 * frames running, which a real transmission does continuously and noise does not.
 *
 * Sibling of src/protocol/dmr/dmr_confidence.{c,h}, which does the same job for DMR.

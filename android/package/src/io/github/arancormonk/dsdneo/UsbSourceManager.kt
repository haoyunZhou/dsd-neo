/**
 * Owns the USB-OTG side of a locally attached RTL-SDR.
 *
 * An app cannot open `/dev/bus/usb` nodes, so the descriptor has to come from
 * [UsbDeviceConnection]. This object obtains it — prompting for permission when
 * needed — and hands it to the engine through [DsdNative.nativeSetUsbFd]; librtlsdr
 * then wraps it instead of enumerating, which is why the engine also skips its own
 * device scan while a descriptor is set.
 *
 * The connection outlives a single decode run and is released only on detach: Java
 * keeps ownership of the descriptor for as long as the engine might use it, and the
 * decoder service deliberately leaves it alone when it is destroyed, which happens
 * at the end of every session. Whatever survives that is closed by process death.

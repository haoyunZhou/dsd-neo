 * @brief P25 trunking state-machine interfaces and constants.
 *
 * This is the unified P25 trunking state machine. Design goals:
 *   - Single state machine for both P25P1 and P25P2
 *   - Minimal timing parameters (hangtime, grant_timeout, cc_grace)
 *   - Single timestamp-based activity tracking per slot
 *   - Unified release path with clear semantics
 *   - Event-driven transitions matching OP25's simpler model

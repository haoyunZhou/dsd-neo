     *   dsd_engine_select_p25_sps_profile(), no_carrier_apply_p25_cc_symbolrate() and the

     *   which is harmless only because whatever that anchor then credits is debited from the
     *   counter they just zeroed and floored there; the -m2/-m3/-m4 branches of the CLI 'm'
     *   case do neither, and are benign only because they run before the first
     *   getFrameSync(). dsd_frame_sync_sps_hunt_restart_dwell() is the one that pays in
     *   full, and is what a new direct assigner should call.
     * sps_hunt_counter_at_entry: sps_hunt_counter as this search cycle began, so a frame
     *   the engine declined to dispatch can hand back exactly what that cycle's search
     *   charged and nothing else (DSD_FRAME_VERDICT_WITHHELD, #392). Restoring to a
     *   snapshot rather than subtracting a count keeps it exact without a second counter:
     *   charging happens only inside frame_sync_advance_sync_window(), between this being
     *   stamped and the verdict being read. The restore is clamped so it can only lower the
     *   counter, which is what makes it safe against the resets that fire in between -- a
     *   profile change, a retune, a trunk-scan target switch -- none of which this can undo.
     * sps_hunt_symbolcnt_mark: dsd_state::symbolcnt as getFrameSync() last returned, so
     *   the next call can measure what the handler consumed in between. It shares that
     *   field's unsigned wrapping type, so the difference stays exact across the counter's
     *   2^32 rollover. Credit is per sync and only counts once it reaches a frame's worth,
     *   which is what keeps the dwell independent of how often an unproductive matcher fires.
     *   Re-anchored alongside the counter whenever frame_sync_apply_sps_hunt_profile() moves
     *   the index, so a fresh budget is never paired with an anchor taken under the outgoing
     *   profile. Inside getFrameSync() the mark is already current at every such call, so that
     *   half is contract rather than repair; it is what a direct assigner would have to do for
     *   itself.
     * sps_hunt_last_frame_verdict: what the last frame handler made of what it consumed,
     *   as a dsd_frame_verdict (engine/protocol_dispatch.h). A field rather than a return
     *   value because frame sync reads it at the next getFrameSync() entry, not at the
     *   call site. Zero is DSD_FRAME_VERDICT_PRODUCTIVE, so a handler that reports nothing
     *   -- and a zeroed dsd_state -- is credited as having decoded a frame; only a
     *   protocol that ran a check and failed it debits nothing (#391), and only one whose
     *   check proves the profile restarts the dwell outright (#400). A frame the engine
     *   declined to dispatch at all is neither, and refunds its own search instead (#392).
     *   Strictly per frame,

 * The gate `keyring_dmr_effective_kid()` applies to a --dmr-tg-key-csv row. "Has any bytes at
 * all" is the wrong question twice over: a scalar cannot serve an AES ALG, and the flat
 * rkey_array aliases segment N of key K onto the scalar of key K + offset, so one unrelated
 * import can make an empty key ID look populated. Requiring the ALG's actual material answers
 * both -- an accidental match then needs as many colliding keys as the ALG needs segments.
 *
 * Tests non-zero segment cells rather than rkey_array_loaded, because a loaded-but-zero cell
 * activates as A_i == 0. Classification must predict activation.
 *
 * @return 1 when @p key_id satisfies @p need; 0 otherwise, including for DSD_KEY_NEED_NONE.

/**
 * Key ID a DMR slot should decrypt with (--dmr-tg-key-csv).
 *
 * A map row for `target` replaces the OTA-signaled key ID, but only when the mapped ID holds the
 * material @p need calls for: a row naming a key that cannot serve this ALG would otherwise zero
 * the slot key and shadow a signaled ID that would have worked, arming a session-permanent
 * lockout on a call that was decryptable. `need` comes from the caller because the ALG numbering
 * is the caller's -- voice IDs in core/audio, DMR data IDs in protocol/dmr.
 *
 * `target_is_group` is load-bearing, not defensive -- DMR radio IDs share the talkgroup's
 * 24-bit space, so an unchecked match keys a unit call off a colliding row.
 *
 * Returns `signaled_kid` unchanged whenever the map does not apply, so callers activate one
 * key ID rather than maintaining a map path and a signaled path in parallel. That includes a
 * `signaled_kid` outside 0..0xFF: DMR key IDs are byte-wide, but `payload_keyid` is shared
 * across protocols and P25 stores a full 16-bit KID there, so the resolver owns the width guard
 * and every caller passes the value it holds without narrowing it first.

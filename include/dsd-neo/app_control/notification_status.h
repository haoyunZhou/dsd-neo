/**
 * @file
 * @brief Compact decoder status for surfaces outside the single-consumer snapshot.
 *
 * The snapshot accessors in @ref snapshot.h are single-consumer: exactly one thread may
 * call them, and on Android that thread is Qt's. The foreground service needs the same
 * facts with no Qt in the picture -- Android can destroy the Activity while the engine
 * keeps decoding, which is precisely when the notification is the only visible surface.
 *
 * So this is a second, far smaller publication: a fixed-size POD copied out under a short
 * mutex, safe to read from any thread and any number of them. It is fed by the telemetry
 * hooks, which run on the decode thread for the whole session (see
 * dsd_app_frontend_runtime_start()), so it keeps updating with no frontend attached.

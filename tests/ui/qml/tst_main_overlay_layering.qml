// The layers over a running session — the wizard, and the spectrum — cover the
// monitor completely, and both carry a full-width button along the bottom. So
// does the monitor: "Stop listening" sits at the same rect underneath them.
//
// TapHandlers never take exclusive grabs, so covering the monitor is not enough
// to stop a tap reaching it; only `enabled` does that. Without it one tap on the
// layer above runs both handlers, and the button the user actually pressed
// finishes by ending the session. That shipped: "Explore from here" — the one
// way out of a view-only spectrum — stopped the session instead of offering to
// hand the tuner over.
//
// This asserts the guard, not the geometry: the rects are free to move apart,
// but nothing underneath an opaque layer should be taking taps regardless.

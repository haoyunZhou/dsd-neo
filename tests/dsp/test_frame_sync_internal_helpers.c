 * dsd_state::symbolcnt free-runs and wraps at 2^32 (issue #395). The hunt measures what a
 * handler consumed as a modular difference against its mark, so a rollover between the mark
 * and the next getFrameSync() entry must still yield the true symbol count -- and a reset to
 * zero must still be recognised as "an unrelated subsystem zeroed it" and credit nothing.
 *
 * This is a contract test, not a regression test: it passes against the pre-#395 signed
 * fields too, because the helper already laundered the subtraction through explicit
 * (unsigned int) casts, which made the arithmetic modular whatever the field types were.
 * It pins the wrap-exactness the uint32_t fields now carry on their own -- so a later widen
 * or re-signing of either field has to keep it -- but it is not what would have caught the
 * overflow. DSP_SYMBOL_REPLAY's test_symbol_count_wraps_instead_of_overflowing() is.
